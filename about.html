        <h1>About me </h1>
        <article>
            <p> I studied law in my country, South Korea. (Yonsei University)
                I went to law school in U.S. too. (Washington University in St. Louis)
                I practiced law in a small law firm in New York and Atlanta, GA.
                While I was practicing law, I thought about doing a different thing. Practing law was full of stress. I also 
                found out that I am not so good at dealing with people.
                Furthermore, I read articles about artificial intelligence everyday. Someday, AI will replace human attorneys.

                After I quit, I decided to dive into software industries. 
                I am still learning, but everyday my life is full of fun. Learning new things is not like studyingk but more like
                playing. I can create new things with my own hand, on my laptop.
